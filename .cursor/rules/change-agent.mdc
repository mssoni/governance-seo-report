# Change Agent Process

When the user describes a change request (new feature, bug fix, enhancement, refactor), follow the 7-step lifecycle in `CHANGE_PROCESS.md`.

## Trigger Detection

Activate this process when the user's message implies a change to the codebase:
- "Add ...", "Fix ...", "Change ...", "Update ...", "Remove ...", "Refactor ..."
- "I want to ...", "Can you ...", "We need ..."
- Bug reports, feature requests, UI tweaks, API changes

## Workflow

1. Read `CHANGE_PROCESS.md` for the full lifecycle
2. Read `CHANGE_LOG.md` to determine the next Change ID (CHG-NNN)
3. Read `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md` for current state
4. Read `backend/CONTRACTS.md` if the change may affect API schemas
5. Decompose the request into stories with acceptance criteria
6. Log the change in `CHANGE_LOG.md` as IN_PROGRESS
7. Create feature branches: `change/chg-nnn-short-description`
8. Spawn dev agents in parallel using the Task tool (backend + frontend, or just one)
9. After dev agents complete, spawn a review agent
10. After review passes, merge feature branches to main
11. Update `CHANGE_LOG.md` status to COMPLETE
12. Report summary to user

## Rules

- Never ask the user for permission to proceed — execute autonomously
- Always use TDD (test first, then implement)
- Always run `make check` before and after changes
- Always update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Use Contract-First if any API schema changes
- Follow the git branching convention: `change/chg-nnn-short-description`
